# Custom Ocarina of Time Music Sequences
The .zip here contains the resources required for custom music sequences in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time while using the Ocarina of Time Randomizer.

# Installation
Download [this zip file](https://github.com/DaruniasJoy/OoT-Custom-Sequences/archive/master.zip) and extract it. Then move the contents of the "Music" that was inside that zip file into the "Music" folder in the "data" folder next to the randomizer script. If you are using the bundled download version of the randomizer the folder is located in the "resources/app/python/data" folder next to the executable file. If done correctly, the Music folder should now have several subfolders in it, each with the name of a different game or series.

# Requests
If there is a song you would like converted to AudioSeq format and added to the repository, feel free to request it [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe17AuRzGGx7WaaX70hggeAYDD-NmXA9rOI2QIKbPCQIhR2tg/viewform). You can also [open an Issue](https://github.com/DaruniasJoy/OoT-Custom-Sequences/issues/new) and request it there.

# Submissions
The best way to submit your own AudioSeqs is by following the [GitKraken guide on the randomizer's wiki](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=GitKraken). As long as the AudioSeq works and doesn't have any objectively bad audio issues it will be merged in.

If you believe a sequence can be better adapted you can either contact the original author and collaborate on improving it to replace the current one, or submit it as a second AudioSeq and meta file with either a number appended to the end (Song Title-2.seq) or a short identifier such as your/your username's initials. (Song Title-dj.seq)

You can also submit a true remix or original creation if you do not wish to recreate a piece of music entirely.
